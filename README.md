    One, called "decentralized" (Decentralization) thoughts, born from the
    beginning of the birth of human society. He is eager to get rid of the center
    and realize direct communication, direct transaction and direct
    communication between people. He believes that one day we may no longer need
    centralised institutions.
    In the long course of human development, this kind of thought has repeatedly
    collided, combined with different organizations, environments and carriers,
    resulting in different social changes. Standing in the current space-time
    dimension, you can still see the decentralized religious church, as well as
    the decentralized political system and social organization.
    The emergence and large-scale use of information technology have brought
    technology carriers to the idea of centralization. Tracing the thread of the
    combination of this idea and technology, a lot of popular and even subversive
    innovations have been produced: P2P download, CND (p-cnd), distributed
    computing (cloud computing), social media (we-media), P2P lending,
    crowdfunding, sharing, blockchain, self-organizing DAO, etc.
    With the development of big data industry to today, exciting results have
    been achieved. Almost all fields are swept by the boom of big data. We can
    see that with the rapid development of Internet information technology and
    the gradual maturity of cloud computing and Internet of things technology,
    the production, collection, storage and processing of massive data are no
    longer a problem, and the potential of data has been released unprecedentedly.
    The era of big data is not an instant birth, but an inevitable result when
    the information society develops to a certain stage.
    In the long run, big data will bring about tremendous changes to the whole
    human society. However, this change can only be achieved through years of
    technology accumulation and social practice, and its development process also
    needs the synchronous development and integration of many related
    technologies.
    The value of big data lies in the integration of multi-source data. The current
    data circulation has seriously restricted the play of the value of big data
    in the whole society, and the problems of data opening, sharing, circulation
    and privacy protection have become the biggest bottleneck in the rapid
    development of big data.
    Everyone realizes that "social big data" can only be achieved when different
    data sources are open and Shared.This goal; Otherwise, data sources that exist
    independently and are not Shared with each other simply form islands of data.
    But the obstacles to open data sharing may be greater than people think. The
    reason is that the current information technology -- database, cloud
    computing, data center and so on are all based on the idea of centralized
    service, which will inevitably lead to a high concentration of data and the
    formation of data monopoly. Therefore, the problem that data monopoly kills
    data innovation will also exist for a long time. How to find an appropriate
    balance between data ownership and data sharing will be one of the core issues
    for the healthy development of the big data ecosystem.
    With the development of information technology, big data and blockchain
    technology, SID is born.
    SID is committed to building a comprehensive platform in the field of
    blockchain for the open, transparent and fair display of information,
    information and data.
    SID is a distributed database system, in which data is automatically backed
    up at all nodes around the world. With the help of cryptography and game theory,
    network security is jointly maintained by all nodes around the world. It is
    difficult for any individual or organization to tamper with system data, so
    it is a credit system. Through the professional technical team, starting from
    the security, efficiency, capacity and processing capacity of the public
    chain, it is possible to expand the blockchain to millions of users and
    millions of transactions per second, improve the efficiency of intelligent
    business development, and reshape the blockchain industry ecology.
    SID is a blockchain platform for creating and developing communities
    dedicated to generating, supporting, and promoting new project proposals
    through a fluid organizational model called the decentralized autonomous
    organization (DAO). By using an untamable blockchain and smart contract
    execution, the DAO achieves autonoous and independent organizational
    governance, management, and operation.
    We believe that with the advent of SID, the world of information and data
    will be transformed.
